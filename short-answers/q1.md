# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
 `favoriteLocations` was changed because it is an array which is a reference data type that allows it to be mutuable. When a method is called upon the array, the method is directly accessing the source or **passing by reference**. Whereas `name` is a primitive string data type where two variables can be assigned to the same value, but are stored independently from each other-- this is also known as **pass by value**. So since there are two copties of the variable, changes can be thought of locally.
